          <h2 id="product-team-member-responsibilities">Product team member responsibilities</h2>

<p><strong>Purpose of this document:</strong> Clarify who, <em>by default</em>, is responsible for key elements of building a product. Why? Because we often have subtly different understandings.</p>

<p><strong>These responsibilities are not exhaustive.</strong> These responsibilities focus on your role as embedded on a product team. A team member may have broader responsibilities to their community, or the organization, that isn’t described here. There may be other important things to do to help your product succeed. We trust team members to do what needs to be done.</p>

<p><strong>If there are multiple team members from a community on a team, they share the responsibilities for their discipline.</strong> For example, if there are multiple developers on a product, they divide up the responsibilities amongst themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Others can (and should) support other team’s responsibilities.</strong> This document describes who’s ultimately accountable. It doesn’t limit who can be involved. Many responsibilities touch many members of a product team.</p>
